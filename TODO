* When using QueueWork mono hangs, even though it gets through the main method.
  Call System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Kill() at the end of
  main if you wan't to get passed it.
* Windows structlayout for uv_process_options_t.
* Not (yet?) exposed:
  - uv_udp_set_membership
  - uv_udp_getsockname
  - uv_read2
  - uv_disable_stdio_inheritane
  - uv_signal_* (mostly linux, only default loop)
  - uv_pipe_pending_instances (windows only)
  - uv_inet_ntop
  - uv_inet_pton
  - uv_setup_args
* get rid of threading functionality?
  monitors and stuff are available in the BCL.
  - uv_mutex_*
* update filewatcher (new struct flag)
  maybe use a more convenient representation in the callback.
* update poll
  maybe use a more convenient representation in the callback.
* Add Open interface?
* Not to expose:
  - Threading and locking functionality
    it is already provided by the .NET BCL and is easier to use.
    - uv_sem_*
    - uv_rwlock_*
    - uv_mutex_*
    - uv_thread_*
  - strutility
    c# has all the string manipulating utilities it needs.
